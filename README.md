## WHAT IS THIS?

This module allows you to write ELF ( [Executable and Linkable Format][Wikipedia ELF] )
files with nothing but pure perl!  Combined with [CPU::x86_64::InstructionWriter][InstWriter]
you can build your own binaries without touching gcc or binutils or any other megalithic
toolchain.

Implementing a compiler is left as an exercise for the reader.

## THAT SOUNDS... UGLY

Actually it's fairly painless, if your needs are simple.

```
  my $elf= ELF::Writer::Linux_x86_64->new(
    type => 'executable',
    segments => [{
      virt_addr   => 0x10000,
      data        => $my_machine_code,
    }],
    entry_point => 0x10000
  );
  $elf->write_file("my_executable");
```

## BUT WHY, DAMMIT? WHY?

If you have to ask why, you are not a member of the intended audience.
Please go on about your business and accept my apologies for this distraction.

## THAT'S CRAZY... BUT UM, WHERE CAN I LEARN ABOUT THIS?

Brian Raiter has a very nice writeup about [diving into the details of ELF][Teensy ELF]
which I found intriguing and educational, and refer back to any time I need to remember
some of this stuff.

Once you see what he's doing, you will understand the inspiration for this module.
